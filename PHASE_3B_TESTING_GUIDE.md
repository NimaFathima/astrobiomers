## 🐛 Known Non-Issues

These are NOT bugs (they're expected):

1. **CSS Linter Warnings**: `@tailwind` directives show warnings - this is normal
2. **No Backend**: Some features need `python backend/app.py` running
3. **Tour Not Auto-Starting**: This is intentional - user clicks button
4. **Focus Outline Everywhere**: This is GOOD - it's for accessibility

---
