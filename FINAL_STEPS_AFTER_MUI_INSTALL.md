## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Page Still Blank:
```powershell
# Check frontend is running
Get-Job | Format-Table

# View logs
Receive-Job -Name "Frontend" -Keep | Select-Object -Last 20

# Restart if needed
Get-Job -Name "Frontend" | Stop-Job
Get-Job -Name "Frontend" | Remove-Job
Set-Location "C:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\frontend\new frontend"
npm run dev
```

### If Evidence Modal Doesn't Open:
- Make sure you're clicking on the **lines/edges** (not the nodes)
- Edges turn blue on hover
- Wait for graph to fully load first

### If Trends Page Errors:
- Check browser console (F12)
- Material-UI should now be available
- Try hard refresh again

### If APIs Timeout:
- Wait longer (Knowledge Graph takes 10-20 seconds)
- Try simpler searches first
- Backend is working (confirmed via tests)
