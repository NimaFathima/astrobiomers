# ✅ DEPENDENCY FIX APPLIED - REDEPLOY NOW!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

**Problem:** Version conflict
```
❌ spacy==3.7.2 (too new for scispacy)
✅ spacy==3.6.1 (compatible)
```

**Status:** ✅ Fix pushed to GitHub (commit d582b86)

---

## 🚀 RENDER WILL AUTO-REDEPLOY

Render should automatically detect the new commit and start redeploying!

### Check Your Render Dashboard:
- Look for "Deploying..." status
- New build starting automatically
- This will take 10-12 minutes

### If No Auto-Deploy:
1. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
2. Select "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for build

---

## 📊 Watch For Success:

The new build should show:
```
✅ Successfully installed spacy-3.6.1
✅ Successfully installed scispacy-0.5.3
✅ Downloading spaCy models
✅ Service is live!
```

---

## 🎯 After Deployment:

Test these URLs (use your actual Render URL):
```
https://your-url.onrender.com/health
https://your-url.onrender.com/docs
https://your-url.onrender.com/api/knowledge-graph?q=stem%20cells
```

**The fix is deployed! Render should be rebuilding now! 🚀**
