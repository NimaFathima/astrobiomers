# 🔧 ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIX GUIDE

## 🎯 The Real Problem

**Neo4j database is NOT running!** ❌

This is why you're seeing:
- ✅ Backend server is running (localhost:8000)
- ✅ Frontend server is running (localhost:3000)  
- ❌ **But Neo4j database is stopped** (localhost:7687)
- ❌ API calls fail → Frontend gets no data → Blank screen

---

## 🚀 **SOLUTION: Start Neo4j**

### Step 1: Open Neo4j Desktop

1. **Find Neo4j Desktop** on your computer
2. **Launch the application**
3. You should see your databases listed

### Step 2: Start the `astrobiomers` Database

In Neo4j Desktop:

1. Look for the database named **`astrobiomers`**
2. Click the **▶ Start** button next to it
3. Wait for status to change to **"Active"** or **"Running"** (green indicator)

### Step 3: Verify It's Running

Run this command in a terminal:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :7687
```

You should see output like:
```
TCP    0.0.0.0:7687          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       12345
TCP    [::]:7687             [::]:0                 LISTENING       12345
```

If you see this, Neo4j is running! ✅

## 🧪 Test the Connection

Once Neo4j is running, test the API:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/statistics
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{"total_papers":98,"total_relationships":42,"total_stressors":6,"total_phenotypes":2}
```

If you see this JSON, everything is working! ✅

---

## 🌐 Refresh Your Browser

After Neo4j is running:

1. **Hard refresh** the browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. Or just press **F5** to reload
3. The dashboard should now load with data! 🎉

---

## 📊 What You Should See

Once Neo4j is running and you refresh:

### Dashboard Will Show:
- ✅ **Statistics cards** with real numbers (98 papers, 42 relationships, etc.)
- ✅ **Search bar** that actually returns results
- ✅ **Featured Stressors** section (6 cards)
- ✅ **Featured Phenotypes** section (2 cards)
- ✅ **Theme toggle** button working
- ✅ **"Explore Graph" button** that shows visualization

## 🔍 Still Having Issues?

### If Neo4j Won't Start:

**Check the database configuration:**

1. In Neo4j Desktop, click on your `astrobiomers` database
2. Click **"Manage"** or the three dots (⋯)
3. Click **"Open Folder"** → **"Configuration"**
4. Verify the password is set correctly

**If you forgot the password:**

The backend expects: `spacebiology123`

To reset it:
1. Stop the database
2. In Neo4j Desktop → Database settings
3. Change the password to: `spacebiology123`
4. Start the database again

### If API Still Fails After Neo4j Starts:

**Restart the backend:**

1. Go to the terminal running the backend
2. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it
3. Restart with:
```powershell
cd backend
C:/Python313/python.exe -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## ✅ Checklist

Before expecting the frontend to work:

- [ ] Neo4j Desktop is installed
- [ ] Database `astrobiomers` exists
- [ ] Database is **STARTED** (green/active status)
- [ ] Port 7687 is listening (check with `netstat`)
- [ ] Backend API returns data: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/statistics`
- [ ] Frontend dev server is running: `npm run dev` in frontend folder
- [ ] Browser refreshed with `Ctrl + Shift + R`

## 📝 Quick Start Order (If Starting Fresh)

```powershell
# 1. Start Neo4j Desktop
# (manually in the app)

# 2. Start Backend (Terminal 1)
cd C:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\backend
C:/Python313/python.exe -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# 3. Start Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd C:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\frontend
npm run dev

# 4. Test API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/statistics

# 5. Open browser
# http://localhost:3000
```
