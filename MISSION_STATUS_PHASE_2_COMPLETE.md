## 🧬 Sample Knowledge Extracted

### Entities Identified
```
Stressors (21):
- microgravity
- cosmic radiation
- isolation
- confinement

- circadian disruption
[... 15 more]

Phenotypes (2):
- bone loss
- immune dysfunction
```

### Relationships Discovered

radiation → induces → DNA damage
isolation → contributes to → psychological stress
confinement → impacts → immune function
spaceflight → causes → muscle atrophy
```

## 📁 Output Files Generated

All files in: `backend/data/pipeline_output/`

| File | Description | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| `raw_papers.json` | 50 curated publications | ~500KB |
| `preprocessed_papers.json` | Cleaned & tokenized text | ~350KB |

## 🔧 Technical Issues Resolved in Real-Time

### JSON Serialization Bug
**Problem:** Pipeline failed at Stage 6 with:
```
TypeError: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable
```

**Root Cause:** NumPy float32 types from SciBERT incompatible with JSON

**Solution:** Created `_convert_to_json_serializable()` helper function
```python
def _convert_to_json_serializable(self, obj):
    """Recursively convert numpy types to Python native types"""
    # Handles dict, list, np.integer, np.floating, np.ndarray
    ...
```

**Result:** ✅ Pipeline now completes all 7 stages successfully

## 🎯 Phase 3: Neo4j Deployment (NEXT)

### What Needs to Happen
1. **Deploy Neo4j Instance** (Choose one option):
   - 🐳 Docker Container (automated, recommended)
   - 💻 Neo4j Desktop (manual, visual)
   - ☁️ AuraDB Cloud (production-ready)

2. **Load Knowledge Graph**:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   python -m knowledge_graph.cli build --papers 50 --load-neo4j
   ```

3. **Validate Deployment**:
   - Open Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474
   - Run test queries
   - Visualize knowledge graph

### Automated Deployment Tool
We've created a deployment wizard for you:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\backend
python deploy_neo4j.py
```

**What it does:**
- Guides through 3 deployment options
- Configures connection settings automatically
- Creates `.env` file with credentials
- Optionally loads knowledge graph
- Validates successful deployment
