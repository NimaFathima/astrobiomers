## 🎯 THREE OPTIONS FOR YOU

### Option A: Continue Hosting (Recommended if 2+ hours left)
- Complete the account setup (30 min)
- Tell me your credentials
- I'll automate the rest (30 min)
- **Result**: Live website with public URL!

### Option B: Pause and Do Later
- Save progress (everything ready to go)
- Focus on NASA submission first
- Deploy after deadline as portfolio piece
- **Result**: Can add live URL later!

### Option C: Switch to Video/Screenshots
- Skip hosting for now
- Record 5-min video walkthrough
- Take 8-10 screenshots
- Submit to NASA
- **Result**: Still impressive, less time!

## 💭 MY HONEST ADVICE

**If you have 2+ hours before deadline**: Go with Option A (hosting)  
**If you have 1-2 hours**: Go with Option C (video/screenshots)  
**If deadline is unclear**: Do Option C first, then try Option A
