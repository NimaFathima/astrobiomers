## Risk Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks

1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - **Risk**: NER/RE models produce low-quality extractions
   - **Mitigation**: Start with pre-trained models, validate on sample data, implement confidence thresholds

2. **LLM API Costs**
   - **Risk**: High costs for OpenAI/Anthropic API usage
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, use cheaper models for testing, consider self-hosted alternatives

3. **Performance Issues**
   - **Risk**: Slow graph queries with large dataset
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, query optimization, strategic indexing

4. **Time Constraints**
   - **Risk**: Cannot complete all features in 10 weeks
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize core features (Pillars 1-3), make Pillar 4 optional

### Medium-Priority Risks

1. **API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk**: Hit rate limits for PubMed, LLM APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Implement exponential backoff, request access increases

2. **Complex Frontend State**
   - **Risk**: State management becomes unwieldy
   - **Mitigation**: Use Redux Toolkit, normalize data structures

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- **Backend Developer**: 1 FTE (Data pipeline, API, NLP)
- **Frontend Developer**: 1 FTE (React, visualization)
- **Full-Stack Developer**: 1 FTE (Integration, deployment)
- **Domain Expert**: 0.25 FTE (Validation, testing)

### Infrastructure
- **Development**:
  - Local: Docker Compose environment

### API Costs (Estimated)
- **OpenAI API**: $200-500/month (development + demo)
- **PubMed**: Free (rate limited)
- **Vector DB**: $100/month (Pinecone starter) or self-hosted (free)
