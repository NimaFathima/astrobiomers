# 🔧 Error Fixes - Complete Resolution

## 📅 Date: October 6, 2025

---

## ✅ All Errors Fixed Successfully

### 🎯 **Summary**
Fixed **5 critical console errors** that were preventing the application from running cleanly in development mode. All errors related to Service Worker conflicts with Vite's development server.

---

## 🐛 Errors Fixed

### 1. **WebSocket Connection Failures** ✅

**Error**:
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8080/?token=...' failed
[Vite] failed to connect to websocket
```

**Cause**: Service Worker was intercepting Vite's Hot Module Reload (HMR) WebSocket connections

**Solution**:
- Updated `public/sw.js` to skip WebSocket connections (`ws:` and `wss:` protocols)
- Added check to skip Vite-specific requests (`/@vite`, `/node_modules/`, `?token=`)
- Service Worker now completely disabled in development mode

**Code Changes** (`public/sw.js`):
```javascript
// Skip WebSocket connections (Vite HMR)
if (url.protocol === 'ws:' || url.protocol === 'wss:') {
  return;
}

// Skip Vite dev server specific requests
if (url.pathname.includes('/@') || url.pathname.includes('/node_modules/') || url.search.includes('?token=')) {
  return;
}
```

---

### 2. **Service Worker Fetch Failures** ✅

**Error**:
```
[SW] Fetch failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch
  at cacheFirstStrategy (sw.js:116)
```

**Cause**: Service Worker trying to cache development assets that should be handled by Vite

**Solution**:
- Added graceful error handling for media assets (`.mp4`, `.webm`)
- Service Worker now skips `/src/` paths entirely in development
- Added fallback to pass through to network without caching

**Code Changes** (`public/sw.js`):
```javascript
// Skip development assets (handled by Vite dev server)
if (url.pathname.startsWith('/src/') || url.pathname.includes('.mp4') || url.pathname.includes('.webm')) {
  console.log('[SW] Skipping dev asset:', url.pathname);
  return;
}

// In catch block - handle media assets gracefully
if (request.url.includes('/src/assets/') || request.url.includes('.mp4') || request.url.includes('.webm')) {
  console.warn('[SW] Media asset not cached (development mode):', request.url);
  return fetch(request).catch(() => new Response('', { status: 404 }));
}
```

---

### 3. **Hero Video 404 Error** ✅

**Error**:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/src/assets/hero-video.mp4 404 (Not Found)
```

**Cause**: Service Worker was intercepting the video request before Vite could serve it

**Solution**:
- Service Worker now completely bypasses all `/src/` requests
- Video loads directly from Vite's development server
- No caching of development assets in dev mode

**Result**: Video loads correctly, no 404 errors

---

### 4. **Speech Synthesis "not-allowed" Errors** ✅

**Error**:
```
[TTS] Speech error: SpeechSynthesisErrorEvent {isTrusted: true, error: 'not-allowed', ...}
```

**Cause**: Browser blocks speech synthesis until user interacts with page

**Solution** (from previous fix):
- Added user interaction check before speaking
- Wrapped `speechSynthesis.speak()` in try-catch
- Speech only activates after user clicks a button
- Graceful error messages instead of console errors

---

### 5. **GuidedTour Infinite Loop** ✅

**Error**:
```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component 
calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a 
dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
```

**Cause**: `speakStep` function in useEffect dependency array causing re-renders

**Solution** (from previous fix):
- Removed `speakStep` from useEffect dependencies
- Added conditional speaking (only after user interaction)
- Added 100ms delay to ensure DOM is ready
- Added eslint-disable comment for intentional dependency omission

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Service Worker Strategy

**Development Mode** (Current):
- ✅ Service Worker **completely disabled**
- ✅ Auto-unregisters any existing service workers
- ✅ All assets served directly by Vite dev server
- ✅ HMR works perfectly
- ✅ No caching conflicts

**Production Mode**:
- ✅ Service Worker **fully enabled**
- ✅ Caches static assets for offline support
- ✅ Network-first strategy for API calls
- ✅ Cache-first strategy for static files
- ✅ Background sync for data updates

### Files Modified

1. **`public/sw.js`** (324 lines)
   - Added WebSocket skip logic
   - Added Vite-specific request skip logic
   - Added development asset skip logic
   - Enhanced error handling for media files

2. **`src/utils/serviceWorker.ts`** (254 lines)
   - Added development mode check
   - Service Worker only registers in production
   - Returns friendly error message in dev mode

3. **`src/App.tsx`** (103 lines)
   - Conditional service worker registration
   - Auto-unregister in development mode
   - Production-only activation

4. **`src/hooks/useTextToSpeech.ts`** (280 lines)
   - User interaction check before speaking
   - Try-catch error handling
   - Graceful permission errors

5. **`src/components/GuidedTour.tsx`** (320 lines)
   - Fixed infinite loop in useEffect
   - Conditional speech activation
   - Improved dependency array

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (5 Errors):
```
❌ WebSocket connection failed (3 instances)
❌ [Vite] failed to connect to websocket
❌ [SW] Fetch failed: TypeError
❌ GET hero-video.mp4 404
❌ Maximum update depth exceeded
```

### After (0 Errors):
```
✅ Clean console - no errors
✅ Vite HMR working perfectly
✅ All assets loading correctly
✅ Service Worker properly disabled in dev

---

## 🎯 Error Prevention Strategy

### Development Best Practices Implemented:

1. **Environment-Specific Behavior**
   - Service Worker only in production
   - Different caching strategies per environment
   - Development assets bypassed in dev mode

2. **Graceful Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks for browser APIs
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Console warnings instead of errors (where appropriate)

3. **Asset Loading Strategy**
   - Development: Direct Vite serving
   - Production: Service Worker caching
   - No conflicts between Vite and SW

4. **User Interaction Requirements**
   - Speech synthesis after user click
   - Notification permission requests
   - Progressive enhancement approach

## 📝 Configuration Summary

### Vite Config (`vite.config.ts`):
```typescript
server: {
  host: "::",
  port: 8080,
}
```

### Service Worker Config:
```javascript
// Development: DISABLED
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  console.log('[SW] Disabled in development');
  // Unregister any existing workers
  navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()
    .then(regs => regs.forEach(reg => reg.unregister()));
}

// Production: ENABLED
if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
  registerServiceWorker();
}
```
