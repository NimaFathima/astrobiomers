- ‚ùå Need to deploy frontend (setup time)
- ‚ùå Need to configure CORS, environment variables
- ‚ùå Risk of deployment issues
- ‚ùå Costs money potentially
- ‚è∞ Takes 3-6 hours minimum

### Video + Screenshots + GitHub:
- ‚úÖ Works with your current setup
- ‚úÖ Shows everything functioning

- Evidence transparency with click-through papers
- Complete UI with all features

**Source Code**: [GitHub Link]
Full implementation available for review.

**Local Setup**: See QUICK_START.md for running locally.

Note: Application uses Neo4j Desktop for local development.
For production deployment, migrate to Neo4j Aura (cloud).
All functionality demonstrated in video.
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME DECISION

**Do you have:**
- **< 2 hours**: Video + Screenshots + GitHub ‚≠ê BEST
- **2-4 hours**: Try quick Railway deploy + Video backup
- **> 4 hours**: Full cloud deployment (Neo4j Aura + Heroku)

**My advice**: With NASA deadline approaching, **go with Video + Screenshots!**

---

## üé¨ NEXT STEPS

1. **Tell me**: Do you want to record video or just submit screenshots?
2. **Then**: I'll guide you through recording/screenshots
3. **Finally**: Package everything and submit!

**You're so close! Video takes 30 minutes and is perfectly acceptable!** üöÄ

Would you like me to:
- A) Guide you through recording video (30 min)
- B) Just do screenshots + GitHub (45 min)
- C) Help with quick Railway deployment (2-3 hours)

**I recommend A or B for your timeline!**
