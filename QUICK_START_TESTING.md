## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Common Issues:

#### Issue 1: Tour doesn't start automatically
**Fix**: Clear browser cache + localStorage
```javascript
// In DevTools console:
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

#### Issue 2: No voice narration
**Fix**: Check browser permissions
- Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Site Settings → Sound → Allow
- Firefox: about:preferences#privacy → Permissions → Autoplay → Allow Audio

#### Issue 3: Backend not responding
**Fix**: Check if backend is running
```powershell
# Test backend:
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

#### Issue 4: Graph doesn't load
**Fix**: Check backend logs for errors
- Look for Neo4j connection issues
- Verify Neo4j is running

#### Issue 5: Audio doesn't play
**Fix**: User interaction required first
- Click anywhere on page before testing audio
- Web Audio API requires user gesture
