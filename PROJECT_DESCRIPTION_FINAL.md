# 🚀 Astrobiomers - Space Biology Knowledge Engine

## 📋 Project Summary

Astrobiomers is an **AI-powered knowledge exploration platform** that transforms over 600 NASA space biology publications into an interactive, searchable knowledge graph. By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), graph databases, and advanced data visualization, we've created an intelligent system that helps scientists, researchers, and space enthusiasts explore how living systems respond to space environments like microgravity and radiation.

Our platform addresses the critical challenge of navigating vast, fragmented scientific literature by:
- **Organizing** decades of space biology research into structured knowledge graphs
- **Visualizing** complex relationships between organisms, compounds, biological processes, and research papers
- **Enabling** intuitive exploration through interactive graph interfaces
- **Accelerating** discovery by revealing hidden connections and knowledge gaps

The system empowers researchers to develop hypotheses faster, mission planners to make data-driven decisions, and innovators to advance technologies in space nutrition, medical countermeasures, and life-support systems.
