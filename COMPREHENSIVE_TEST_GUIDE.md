- **AI Assistant Response:** 5-15 seconds
- **Page Navigation:** < 1 second

---

## üö® Error Monitoring

### Check Browser Console:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors (red messages)

### Common Errors to Ignore:
- Neo4j deprecation warnings (about `id()` vs `elementId()`)
- CORS preflight (if OPTIONS requests shown)

### Errors to Report:
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 404 Not Found (unless you search for non-existent term)
- Frontend crash/white screen
- "Failed to fetch" errors

---

## üîß Quick Troubleshooting

### If Knowledge Graph Doesn't Load:
1. Check backend terminal for errors
2. Look for "Connection reset" message
3. Wait 10 seconds, try again
4. If persists, restart backend:
   ```powershell
   Stop-Process -Name python -Force
   cd C:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\backend
   python main.py
   ```

### If Frontend Doesn't Load:
1. Check if Vite server running (terminal shows "ready in X ms")
2. Try refreshing page (Ctrl+R)
3. Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. If persists, restart frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\frontend\new frontend"
   npm run dev
   ```

### If Both Servers Stop:
Run this command:
```powershell
# Backend (in one terminal)
cd C:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\backend; python main.py

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd "C:\Users\mi\Downloads\ASTROBIOMERS\frontend\new frontend"; npm run dev
```
