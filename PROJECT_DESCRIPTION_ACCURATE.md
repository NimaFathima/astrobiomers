## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Honest Assessment)

1. **Deployment Challenges**
   - Backend deployment blocked by C++ compilation issues (hdbscan, nmslib)
   - Free tier hosting insufficient for ML library builds
   - Local application fully functional, cloud deployment in progress

2. **Feature Gaps**
   - No automatic paper summarization (BART/PEGASUS not integrated)
   - No voice/audio features (claimed in description but not implemented)
   - No offline functionality (no service workers)
   - Basic accessibility (not full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

3. **Scalability**
   - Currently limited to 608 papers (can scale with more processing)
   - RAG assistant requires OpenAI API key (cost consideration)
   - Neo4j Aura free tier has size limits

4. **Data Coverage**
   - Space biology focus only (not all NASA research)
   - English-language publications only
   - Open-access papers only (paywall limits)
